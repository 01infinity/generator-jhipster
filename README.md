Hipster stack for Java developers
==========================

Presentation
------------------

**This project is not yet finished!!! We are currently working on an alpha release**

*If you want to help, we will put tasks on [our Github issues page](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open)*

This is a Yeoman generator, used to create a Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS project.

You can install and use it easily:

- See the [Yeoman community generators page](http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html) or
- Go get [the official package on npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/package/generator-jhipster) 

Goals
-------------------

Generate a complete and modern Web app, unifying:

- Maven on the server side
- Yeoman + Bower + Grunt on the client side

Technology stack on the server side
