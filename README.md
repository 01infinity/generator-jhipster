**This project is not yet finished!!! We are currently working on an alpha release**

*If you want to help, we will put tasks on [our Github issues page](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open)*

This is a Yeoman generator, used to create a Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS project.
